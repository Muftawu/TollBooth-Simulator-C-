Overview
	-This is a simple C++ script that simulates the car Toll booth system.

How it works
	When a car passes by, the program increases the car count by 1 whether
	it paid or not. 

	For a car that pays before passing by, $1.25 in added to the toll total
	and $0 is added to the toll total for cars that pass by without paying.


	The simulation works in such a way that, a input response of 'a' from 
	a user will denote a paying car and 'b' denotes a non-paying car. 
	
	The program will quit and display the toll total and car total when a 
	user presses the 'q' key.
